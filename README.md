# Overview

I really wanted to get some experience working in the front-end, so I decided that I would practice with React Native using JavaScript. I led a small team of four people to work on this project with me. Josh Bushman was in charge of the color pallette, images, and overall visual finalization. Christian Viazzo was in charge of app visual structure and its implementation. Jeremy Busch worked on our firebase connections and I worked on the background functionality, and I helped with each of the aforementioned sections of our code. 

Our app, Game Night, is an app designed to help users find fun local events where they can do what they want with like-minded people. It has built in chat functions, authentication, and a live even feed.

# Development Environment

Our app uses React Native, a library that extends the JavaScript language.
